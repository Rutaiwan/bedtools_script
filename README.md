# bedtools_script
This is a basic script to use Bedtools (https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/maskfasta.html) to mask your reference FASTA with .bed file (core-self, phaster and gubbins).
It will create an output of a reference (FASTA) that has been masked from Bedtools then calculate and count the number of nucleotides (As, Cs, Gs, Ts and Ns) in the FASTA output reporting into .tsv format for future usage.
